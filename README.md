## [Boom][kudos] Token Contracts

![Boom](kudos.jpg)

Boom is a rewards and performance driven currency built on top of the [Ethereum][ethereum] blockchain. Boom is the fastest and easiest way to rate and equitably reward both users and workers. By leveraging the blockchain to achieve complete transparency, Boom restores trust in ratings through cryptographically verified transactions that cannot be manipulated by ads or algorithms.

The Boom token contracts are written in [Solidity][solidity] and tested using [truffle][truffle] and [testrpc][testrpc].

#### Dependencies

```bash
# install truffle and testrpc packages globally
$ npm install -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc

# install local node dependencies in project directory
$ npm install
```

#### Run Tests

```bash
# run testrpc instance (make sure no other ethereum clients are running)
$ ./scripts/testrpc.sh

# run smart contract tests
$ truffle test
```

#### Generate Code Coverage Report

```bash
# run solidity-coverage tool
$ ./scripts/coverage.sh

# view report at ./coverage/index.html
```

## launch sequence ðŸš€

1. deploy the BoomToken contract with `truffle deploy`

2. move the `stash/3_deploy_tokensalecontract.js` migration script to the `migrations` folder

3. in the `migrations/3_deploy_tokensalecontract.js` file:

   - specify the wallet address that will receive ETH in the crowdsale in the `wallet` variable

   - specify the address of the deployed token contract in the `tokenContractAddress` variable

4. deploy the BoomTokenSale contract with `truffle deploy`

5. fund the crowdsale contract with the Boom tokens created in step 1 (the amount should match the value of the `amountOfTokensForSale` variable in the BoomTokenSale contract)

   for example, in `truffle console`:
```bash
> BoomToken.deployed().then(function(instance) { token = instance});
> BoomTokenSale.deployed().then(function(instance) { sale = instance});
> token.transfer(sale.address, web3.toWei('4000000000', 'ether'));
```

6. whitelist users for each tier with the `registerTier1Users` and `registerTier2Users` functions, remove users from the whitelist with the `unregisterUsers` function
